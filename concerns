annotations
default arguments
unescape_html
handler vs handlers (empty list vs null)
for loop is assumed non-empty!!!! for(s1;s2;s3) {} with any of s1, s2, s3 empty gives Parser.InvalidArgument

tests using FunctionDeclaration as statement, goes against spec recommendation
ch12/12.14/12.14-13.js
ch12/12.8/S12.8_A4_T3.js

parser tests expected to fail
test_do_while due to test for @invariant annotation
test_continue due to test for @invariant annotation
test_continue_label due to test for @invariant annotation
test_break due to test for @invariant annotation
test_break_label due to test for @invariant annotation
test_for due to test for @invariant annotation, would also fail due to minor offset calculation differences between parsers
test_getter due to minor offset calculation differences between parsers
test_setter due to minor offset calculation differences between parsers
test_top_annotations due to test for @topensures annotation
